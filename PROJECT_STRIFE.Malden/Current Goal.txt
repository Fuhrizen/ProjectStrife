THIS IS MP FOCUSED SO LOCALLITY OF MARKERS AND VARS ARE IMPORTANT

Generate a unit with it's varSpace being represented by an in-game object. (Avoid using AI due to performance concern, but also to avoid using their pathfinding.)

Allow a unit to be spawned and deleted during runtime.

Allow a player to select units and assign movement with right clicks, with shift right-clicking generating a queue of targetpositions.

Double clicking on a unit to open a GUI (For now just have a method to rename the marker, this can be worked on at a later date)

Each unit will be assigned a 'side' (Doesn't have to follow typical blufor,opfor,indep) each player will also have be assigned the sides
the they are capable of controlling and viewing.

Each player can only see their unit's side. Unit's will have a recceRange that will reveal units within _x metres/grids of itself to the owner.
This can be effected by unit's elevation up to 140% of the original amount.

Things to consider:

Local markers but global varSpaces/Object for the revealing system.
Revealing system will be togglable but for now use revealSystem = T/F

Movement doesn't need to be a smart AI that follows roads (However if it can be done reasonably why not, otherwise can be completed later) 
Attempt to use Bresenhams line algorithm in worst case scenario.

No need to select multiple unit's at once, and if possible avoid overlapping units.

Timescale : A global var to define the speed of simulation.

Draw a path of a unit only when they are selected.

If a unit is selected and another unit is right clicked cause an event, hint format "%1 : %2",_selectedUnit,_targetUnit]

Movement traits/features

isAmphibious : T/F  can it move on water?
isAir : T/F can it ignore terrain features?

landSpeed : Unit speed on land 
waterSpeed : Unit speed on water
airSpeed : Unit speed in air

Terrain, if the unit is traveling uphill, (Elevations such as mountains, avoid applying on hills) have upto 80% modifer applied.
Roads, if a unit is within 8m of a road apply a bonus 20% to speed.
Unit speed, 3 toggable states, slow,moderate and fast (Walk,Jog,Dash) Walk = 60% Speed | Jog =  100% Speed | Dash = 120% Speed
Forests, if the unit is nearby _x amount of tree they are considered in a forest, recceRange will be halved along with halving other elements ability to see that Unit.
